  \item Led a state-mandated project requiring SDG\&E to target certain customers for specific electric rates \& technologies; used cluster analysis to create customer profiles of 500k customers using a combination of internal SDG\&E and Census data to segment customers based on demographics and electric usage; cluster analysis was later used with supervised machine learning to predict which customers might be likely candidates for the proposed new rates. 
  
  
  \item Member of SDG\&E's Office of Data Science, a small volunter team responsible for helping foster and spread data science across the company; helped develop one of SDG\&E's first data dive events, an all day event focused on teaching the basics of cluster analysis to others at the company; helped test the feasibility of deploying graph databases across the company and creating learning materials for the Cypher language; helped create internal how-to guides detailing to employees how they can access and install various data science tools, such as Conda, Git, Python, R, and Azure DevOps.  

    
  \item Oversee all aspects of survey questionnaire and design for the marketing team, including managing survey vendor relations and survey sampling procedures; help develop methods to create survey weights and other bias reduction techniques with the survey data given from vendors; review data files for accuracy, completeness, and adherence to company standards.
  
  
  \item Create interactive dashboards in R Shiny illustrating various metrics and descriptive characteristics of SDG\&E customers for senior management and staff; merged SDG\&E data with various government data sources, such as Census, BLS and other sources to illustrate underserved \& harder to reach communities in the broader San Diego area for company focus, results were later incorporated into regulatory briefings; built interactive demographic profiles of customers at each zip code/census tract level for more targeted marketing campaigns and customer modeling.
