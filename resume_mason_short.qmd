  \item Led a state-mandated project requiring SDG\&E to target certain customers for specific electric rates \& technologies; used cluster analysis to create customer profiles of 500k customers using a combination of internal SDG\&E and US Census data to segment customers based on demographics and electric usage; cluster analysis was later used with supervised machine learning to predict which customers might be likely candidates for the proposed new electric rates. 
  
  
  \item Contributing  member of SDG\&E's Office of Data Science, a small volunteer team responsible for fostering and spreading data science across the company; helped develop one of SDG\&E's first data dive events, an event teaching the basics of cluster analysis; helped test the feasibility of deploying graph databases across the company and creating learning materials for the Cypher language; helped create internal how-to guides detailing to employees how to access and install various data science tools.

    
  \item Oversee all aspects of survey questionnaire and design for the marketing team, including managing survey vendor relations and survey sampling procedures; help develop methods to create survey weights, sampling frame design, and review/edit questionnaires; review data files for accuracy, completeness, and adherence to company standards.
  
  
  \item Create interactive dashboards in R Shiny to display various metrics and descriptive characteristics of SDG\&E customers for senior management and staff; merged SDG\&E data with various government data sources, such as Census, BLS and other sources to illustrate underserved \& difficult to reach communities in the broader San Diego area for company focus, results were later incorporated into regulatory briefings as well as modeling for more targeted customer marketing.

    \item Conducted statistical analysis of both survey and non-survey data; created cross-tabs of survey data using the statistical software R and SPSS; created regression models in R on survey data to test survey findings; created automated scripts in R to test for inter-coder reliability on open-end survey data; tested the statistical significance of survey findings; calculated variance and standard errors of Census microdata survey estimates using replicate weights.  
    
  \item Managed various Pew Research Center projects and publications; responsible for leading meetings, overseeing, and creating strict documentation for junior staff members to follow for the manual coding and categorization of open-end survey and non-survey data; created the sampling frame of Pew's journalist survey, which included over 100k+ journalists in the frame, also supervised the development of the webscraping used to create the frame; led a small team in performing a content analysis of newsroom layoff data, results were later part of a short report.
  
  \item Created and coauthored a series of short reports using economic and demographic data from the Census Bureau and BLS to describe the changing landscape of newsroom employment and employees in the U.S.; collected and analyzed the data and wrote the methodology describing the scopes and limits of the data; the reports were some of the most cited from the Pew journalism team.
